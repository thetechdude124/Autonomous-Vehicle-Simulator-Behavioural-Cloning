# Autonomous-Vehicle-Simulator-Udacity-

Hi! My Name is Aditya Dewan, and this is a project I've done involving simulating an autonomous car within Udacity's self driving car simulator (inspired by a tutorial from Siraj Raval from YouTube). 

The project uses a server-client model to run the CNN on live images sent in from the simulator. The CNN outputs a steering angle, which is then sent to the simulator to drive the actual car.

Regardless, the CNN still isn't perfect - I'm making regular updates to this file as I find better models with lower loss values. 

Regards,

Aditya Dewan
